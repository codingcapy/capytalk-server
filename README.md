# CapyTalk Client

This is the server side back end of CapyTalk, a chat app that I developed recently. It uses Node and Express, as well as typsecript, ts-node, socket.io, cors, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, mongodb, mongoose, nodemon and bcrypt.

To run:
1. npm install
2. create a mongoDB database and cluster at www.mongodb.com
3. create a .env file with the following content: MONGO_URI=your_mongoDB_connect_uri
4. npm start
